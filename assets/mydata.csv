Implementing OAuth2 Clients with Flutter made simple,"This article introduces Open Authorization (OAuth2) as a solution to streamline user registration for new services. It guides readers through implementing OAuth2 in a Flutter application using Google as the provider and Appwrite as the OAuth2 client. The prerequisites include basic Dart and Flutter understanding, Flutter SDK installation, Xcode with a developer account, a free Appwrite account, and a Gmail account. The process involves creating an Appwrite project, enabling Google OAuth2, setting up Google OAuth 2.0, and implementing the functionality in Flutter using the provider package for state management. The article concludes by showcasing the resulting Flutter app with Google OAuth2 integration.This article introduces Open Authorization (OAuth2) as a solution to streamline user registration for new services.
